## Best Brand Chatbots: Panel | Do Not Recommend
 - Piers Lingle, SVP of Customer Experience, Comcast, Ambreen Molitor, Senior Director, Digital Product Lab, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Dr. Jason Mars is Co-founder & CEO, Clinc, Burak Arik, CEO of MaxiTech Inc., a subsidiary of Isbank
 - Launched a bot in the text and device channels... what is your opinion on voice automation? what is the maturity of that technolgoy?
    - Originally started with voice; 14k hours of "utterances" per day
    - People are much more casual with speak (as opposed to text)
    - Expression is challenging when it comes to speach as well (when translating to text), which changes the operating channel
 - Botsociety Question: How important is designing the experience before building it? How did you approach this problem?
    - Scoping and designing the experience happens at the front
    - before you start collecting data, you should know what your design will be
    - ... "be agile"... iterate on top of design...
    - CX operations are critical to design steps; experience will vary based on channel... taking these into consideration is important....
    - Design impacts the tone of the experience / content. 
        - being non-judgemental, and assessing the way to respond to voice / chat inquirires is a difficult aspect of design
    - JL: this was a bad question, with equally bad responses, except for 
 - How did you assess whether or not you had trust with users (planned parenthood)?
    - planned to be general neutral, which manifested into a gender neutral avatar
    - the goal was to strip the foundation of a text message
    - [roo](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/roo-sexual-health-chatbot)
    - attempted to reinvent text in order to come away:
        - this is a playful, safe environment
        - If you take time to repsond, then it demonstrates gestures in order to engage the user
        - It allows the user to engage and immerse themselves in the engagement with a chatbot

 - Goal is to: _"Enirch life by presenting the universe of audio as a personalized experience, prioritizing the content you love most"_
 - Using habits, tastes, locations to personalize a music experience
 - **Use Case: Personalized Podcast Recommendation System:**
    - Competed against *trending* and *user recommended*
    - Discovered that people that listened to the recommended information were retaining more information than others.
    - The other channels weren't getting it right as frequently, and so people weren't remembering as much from the series.
    - Personalized programming (through "Your Weekly Mix Tape") resulted in a +10% improvmeent in subscription retention
    - _My Favorites Radio_ highest next day retnetion of any station +45-50%
 - It is challenging to provide good recommendations without making it "creepy"
    - 1:1:1 recommendations is very challenging, and ML provides that level of granularity
 - They had to answer the question: How do you know you aren't deterministically driving popularity for certain recommendations by simply showing those over others?
    - A/B testing.........
    - Most dependent on experimentation in order to get signals
    - "testing has to be the platform for everything that you do..."
    - "if you aren't challenging everything you do through testing, it is a hard miss..."
 - **The challenge with hyper customization is that the set of recommendation is too narrow**
    - This is the challenge of personalization
    - They use Human-in-the-loop systems to curate the experience of recommendation
        - HIL systems also allow for high refresh rate on results
        - HIL systems can greatly increase the rate of data collection, because you can prompt users for feedback (as much as the user is willing to provide)
 - What would you recommend for the person starting to approach personalization?
    - Start earlier, start simple - early wins were thinking through common sense about the thought process of a user before going too complex
    - **Know the question you're trying to answer - determine whether a customer or business problem!**
        - solving business problems through personalization is very challenging.
        
## Titan Panel: The state of conversational AI | Conversational AI Summit | VB Transform 2019 | Medium Recommend
 - **Panel of Watson, Alexa** - Mitch Mason, Senior Offering Manager, Watson Assistant, IBM, Lisa Falkson, Senior VUI Designer, Amazon, Noelle LaCharite, Principal PM Manager, MSAI, Microsoft
 - Watson helps in a variety of ways (for both customers and employees)
 - Introductions
     - There are 4 typical kinds of use cases that help both kinds of users to be more efficient at achieving their outcomes:
        1. Let customers / employees self-serve faster
        2. Assist agents as they work (through search and dialog)
        3. Help experts find answers
     - Amazon Alexa
        - Alexa was transactional, and originally designed for the home
        - Moving forward targeting more conversational experiences and environments (on the go, in the car, gaming... etc.)
        - Alexa has improved by 20% in accuracy, and has 80k skills with more than 1 million customers
     - Microsoft Search, Assistant, and Intelligence
        - [Converational AI: Azure bot Service + Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/)
        - integration service to deploy across multiple bots / platforms
 - What brought you personally to bots?
     - How do you make experience / ubiquitous? Overcoming adversity and differences by using language (which is highly accessible)
 - How do you consider the different contexts within which people use chatbots?
     - the reality is that people use devices in different ways 
     - Car vs. Home - the difference was that people were interested in very different functions and use cases based on the environment
        - This meant Alexa had to learn different skills, tools, and be primed for certain actions ahead of time.
        - Customization (based on the environment) requires a high amount of social tuning
        - Certain use cases also require privacy, and sometimes voice is not the best medium for interacting with a bot
     - Allowing for feedback in the engagement is also difficult.
     - **The burden of maintaining context is on the developer to establish use cases and make sure that the technology maps to the context.**
 - What do you feel the sentiment is around privacy today and how it will change?
     - part of the concern with how popular Alexa became
     - today - people are willing to give data away if we get value out of the interaction
     - As vendors, we need to be transparent about what kind of data is being captured
     - The feedback relationship (in the exchange of data for value) can be off-balance with "always on" settings; getting ads is uncomfortable and unsettling
 - What would be the advice you would give businesses and leaders who want to integrate voice?
     - Start small with a narrow use case.
     - Whatever your highest value is, integrate voice around that. If you can reduce digital friction through voice, then do it.
